# Python Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my Python Projects Portfolio! This repository is a growing collection of small Python programs that I am developing as a way to sharpen my programming skills, explore new ideas, and demonstrate my ability to create functional and interesting applications. My goal is to use this repository as a living portfolio that showcases my skills as a developer and my passion for problem-solving with code. While I do have some more complex projects, this repository is dedicated to very small programs that can be useful in different ways.

### Current Projects:

1. **diceAPP**: A simple but visually appealing dice simulator. It's perfect for times when you need a quick and reliable way to roll a die, whether for a board game or just for fun.

2. **PassGenerator**: A customizable password generator that helps create strong and secure passwords. Security is a priority, and this project aims to make generating secure credentials easy and intuitive.

3. **WordSearcher**: A handy tool for searching specific words within text files. This can be used for quickly finding keywords or phrases in large documents.

### What's Next?

I plan to add more small projects regularly as I continue learning and experimenting with Python. The goal is not just to build programs but to learn by doing, iterating, and refining my skills.

Feel free to explore the projects, provide feedback, or even suggest ideas for new programs. I'm excited to continue building and sharing my progress with the community.
