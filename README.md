# Python Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my Python Projects Portfolio! This repository is a growing collection of small Python programs that I am developing as a way to sharpen my programming skills, explore new ideas, and demonstrate my ability to create functional and interesting applications. My goal is to use this repository as a living portfolio that showcases my skills as a developer and my passion for problem-solving with code. While I do have some more complex projects, this repository is dedicated to very small programs that can be useful in different ways.

### Current Projects:

1. [**diceAPP**](./diceAPP): A simple dice simulator built with a visually appealing interface using PyQt5. It features an animated rolling effect and a history log of results, making it fun and engaging to use. Ideal for quick dice rolls in board games or casual fun.

2. [**PassGenerator**](./PassGenerator): A customizable password generator with an easy-to-use graphical interface built in PyQt5. It allows you to generate strong passwords with options for length, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. You can also save passwords to an Excel file and view them later. Security and convenience combined.

3. [**WordSearcher**](./WordSearcher): A versatile tool for searching specific words or phrases in various file formats, including .txt, .docx, and .pdf files. With a user-friendly interface, it supports folder selection, progress tracking, and exporting search results, making it perfect for quickly finding content in large document collections.

### What's Next?

I plan to add more small projects regularly as I continue learning and experimenting with Python. The goal is not just to build programs but to learn by doing, iterating, and refining my skills.

Feel free to explore the projects, provide feedback, or even suggest ideas for new programs. I'm excited to continue building and sharing my progress with the community.
